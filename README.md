Gif Viewer Modernized
A modernized fork of the classic Gif Viewer from SourceForge. This version has been rescued from legacy codebases, upgraded to .NET 4.8, and optimized for modern Windows environments.

Framework Upgrade: Migrated from .NET 4.5 to .NET 4.8 for better stability and security.
Modern Tooling: Full compatibility with Visual Studio 2026 and MSBuild.
Dependency Fixes: Resolved legacy resource serialization issues (MSB3822).
Fresh Coat of Paint: Updated UI elements for a cleaner look on Windows 10/11.
Dark mode: dark mode.

This project is a fork of the original Gif Viewer hosted on SourceForge, created by p_reagan in 2013. As the original project has been dormant for over a decade, this fork aims to keep the utility alive and functional for the modern era.
